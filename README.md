> a whack at simulating random character interactions.

## overview

to make a believable world of npcs, i need to make characters that have their own personalities, goals, and dispositions.

this is an attempt to model NPCs, so that I can describe generic rules like

"If an angry hero meets an outlaw, he attacks."

and simulate the combinatorial effects of their behavior.

still a wip
